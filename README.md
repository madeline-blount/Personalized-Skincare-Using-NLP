### Abstract
In our project, SKINsight: Leveraging Sentiment Analysis For Personalized Skincare Recommendations, aims to recommend skincare products tailored to specific skin concerns by analyzing Sephora customer reviews. Our research explored the potential of sentiment analysis and keyword tokenization to identify the best products for various skin concerns and skin types. By integrating two datasets from Kaggle:one containing product information and the other comprising user reviews. We developed a recommendation model using features such as sentiment scores, average ratings, and associated ingredients.

Our project aimed to analyze a comprehensive dataset of products sold at Sephora, exploring their attributes and customer reviews. We recognize that consumers often have unique concerns regarding their skin, and with the overwhelming variety of products available, it can be difficult and even intimidating to choose the right one. Our goal was to develop a model that would help consumers save time, money, and effort by helping them easily find the ideal product tailored to their specific skin concerns.

Utilizing over one million user reviews collected from Kaggle, we conducted sentiment analysis using Vader and applied TF-IDF vectorization within a logistic regression model for multi-label classification. Our analysis effectively identified top skin concerns, including "Pores," "Dullness/Uneven Texture," and "Dryness," by examining products with high sentiment scores, average ratings, and positive customer reviews. We then categorized reviews into five primary skin types—oily, combination, dry, normal, and sensitive—to summarize key ingredients most associated with each type. Through continued model training, we identified products with high user satisfaction for specific skin concerns. We found out "Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer" achieved the highest sentiment score (0.81) and average rating (4.62) for addressing "Pores." Other notable high-performing products included the "Pumpkin Enzyme Mask Enzymatic Dermal Resurfacer" and "Therapeutic Sulfur Acne Treatment Mask."

Our findings revealed that products with common ingredients tend to generate higher customer satisfaction. The "Pumpkin Enzyme Mask Enzymatic Dermal Resurfacer" particularly stood out for its effectiveness against "Dullness/Uneven Texture." These results demonstrate the feasibility of using sentiment analysis and ingredient data to guide customers in selecting optimal skincare products. The final recommendations for "Pores," one of the most common skin concerns, showcased top-rated products: "Pumpkin Enzyme Mask" and "Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer". These recommendations were carefully selected based on high sentiment scores and alignment with user preferences across different skin types. By incorporating neutral reviews, we ensured a balanced and comprehensive analysis that provides nuanced product insights.
